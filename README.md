# PowerBI-Snowflake-Sample


Snowflake Usage Sample Report

This project contains a sample Power BI Usage Report and instructions to setup the Database, Views, User, Role and Warehouse.  Setup is quick - download the 3 files, open the file named 'Power BI Snowflake Usage Sample Report Setup Instructions" and follow the instructions step by step.  

Snowflake Sales Engineers seeking an oppotunity to obtain some hands on experience setting up and interacting with a Power BI Report are the target audience for this initial release.  This report currently leverages views created in Snowflake, Power BI Composite model (ie, contains both DirectQuery Mode and Import Mode datasets) and calculated columns using DAX.

We will continue to update the features and scenarios included in the sample report based on your feedback.
